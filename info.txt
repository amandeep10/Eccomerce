Controller :

Hooks(callbaks):-

Controller::beforeFilter()
This function is executed before every action in the controller. It’s a handy place to check for an active session or inspect user permissions.

Controller::beforeRender()
Called after controller action logic, but before the view is rendered. This callback is not used often, but may be needed if you are calling render() manually before the end of a given action.

Controller::afterFilter()
Called after every controller action, and after rendering is complete. This is the last controller method to run.


CakeResponse:-
CakeResponse provides a number of useful methods for interacting with the response you are sending to a client.
$this->response->location();
$this->response->compress();

$this->set('data',$data); //set the data to called in the view.
$this->render()  //view file name to be rendered.
$this->autoRender;
$conditions=$this->postConditions($this->request->data);
$this->Order->find('all', compact('conditions'));
//Use this method to turn a set of POSTed model data (from HtmlHelper-compatible inputs) into a set of find conditions for a model.



Request and Response objects¶ :-
$this->request, and is available in Controllers, Views and Helpers.

Controller::requestAction(string $url, array $options) 
This function calls a controller’s action from any location and returns data from the action. The $url passed is a CakePHP-relative URL (/controllername/actionname/params). To pass extra data to the receiving controller action add to the $options array

// URL is /posts/index?page=1&sort=title
$this->request->query['page'];

// View/Elements/latest_comments.ctp
$comments = $this->requestAction('/comments/latest');
foreach ($comments as $comment) {
    echo $comment['Comment']['title'];
}

$this->request->webroot contains the webroot directory.
$this->request->base contains the base path.
$this->request->here contains the full address to the current request.
$this->request->query contains the query string parameters.


find ()
Used to perform find operations, where the first argument is type of find operation to perform
 * (all / first / count / neighbors / list / threaded),
 * second parameter options for finding (indexed array, including: 'conditions', 'limit',
 * 'recursive', 'page', 'fields', 'offset', 'order', 'callbacks')

### Disabling callbacks
 *
 * The `callbacks` key allows you to disable or specify the callbacks that should be run. To
 * disable beforeFind & afterFind callbacks set `'callbacks' => false` in your options. You can
 * also set the callbacks option to 'before' or 'after' to enable only the specified callback.
