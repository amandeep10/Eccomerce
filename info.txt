Controller::beforeFilter()
This function is executed before every action in the controller. It’s a handy place to check for an active session or inspect user permissions.

Controller::beforeRender()
Called after controller action logic, but before the view is rendered. This callback is not used often, but may be needed if you are calling render() manually before the end of a given action.

Controller::afterFilter()
Called after every controller action, and after rendering is complete. This is the last controller method to run.
